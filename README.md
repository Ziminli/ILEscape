# ILEscape

The purpose of the ILC escape game is to simulate a traditional escape room experience you would complete with friends, centered around Queens Engineering culture. The setting of the game is a building on campus that all Engineering students know very well. At some point, every Queens Engineering student has spent time in the building studying for an exam, completing an assignment, or working on any of the several extra curriculars hosted inside. This setting along with the premise of the game brings a fun and familiar experience for the students to enjoy. The game itself acts as a fun problem-solving puzzle that will challenge users to utilize a variety of thought processes to succeed, something beneficial for those getting a problem-solving degree. Additionally, it would provide students an opportunity to imagine themselves in the ILC should remote learning be reinstated due to the COVID-19 pandemic later in the year.
